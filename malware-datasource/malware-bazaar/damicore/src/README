 Overview
 ------------------------------

 lineshuffle	reads an input text file and produces n output files consisting
 		of unique permutations of the lines of the input file. The
		program is optimized to produce permutations in linear time.

 csv-colfiles   reads a data file in CSV format and creates one file for each
   		column in the input file. The name of each file is the column
		title. Each output file is comma-separate list of the values
		present in the respective column.
		
 csv-sort       reads a data file in CSV format and outputs the same file
 		with lines sorted (in ascending or descending order) according
		to the select column. Both numerical and categorical data
		can coexist in the same column. 

 safename.sh    rename all files in a directory to circumvent current
 		limitations of damicore in handling fancy file names (e.g.
		containing blanks, non-alphanumeric characters etc.).
		The program is a temporary workaround.
