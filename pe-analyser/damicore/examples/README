 EXAMPLES
 ==============================

 In order to experiment with the examples in this directory, go to the top of
 the project source tree, build and install the software as follows

 $ ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/examples
 $ make install

 Then, enter the example directory

 $ cd examples

 There you'll find some data directories.

 For instance, directory ab contains a set of 10-character files composed of
 different combinations of characters A and B. In order to try it, execute

 $ bin/damicore ab

 (or run the script ab.sh which does exactly this)

 The current directory should be populated with the generated distance matrix,
 the phylogenetic tree in newick format and the detected communities. The
 graphical visualization tool should also open automatically.

 The script clean.sh simple delete the generated files.
