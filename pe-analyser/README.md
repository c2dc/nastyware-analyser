# Analyser

Nastyware-analyser module that will be in charge to analyse information obtained from further modules. 

## Features

**DAMICORE**

This module provides an interface to use the DAMICORE program to process data generated elsewhere. Since there are two separate implementations of DAMICORE, using C and Python, the main script (`pe-analyser`) provides an interface to both.
